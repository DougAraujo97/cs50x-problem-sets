                    For a long time I've been making videos and livestreaming content online to pay the bills,
                    but after so many years I've been feeling burned out. I have a few friends who work as
                    software developers and they motivated me to learn to code and even possibly find a job as a
                    developer in the future. I thought back to the basic HTML course I took in high school and I
                    remembered thinking it was a lot of fun, so I gave it a shot. I signed up for CS50 because of how highly
                    recommended it was, despite it being very difficult, and I must say, it's been worth it so far. I've discovered
                    a passion for coding and the fact it requires me to constantly learn new things and solve problems creatively.
                    That said, here are some goals for the future:
